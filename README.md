# Text Improvement Engine

## Objective
The Text Improvement Engine is a tool designed to analyze a given text and suggest improvements based on the similarity to a list of standardized phrases. These standardized phrases represent the ideal way certain concepts should be articulated, and the tool recommends changes to align the input text closer to these standards.

## Features
- User-friendly GUI for text input and suggestion display.
- Semantic analysis using spaCy for similarity comparison.
- Suggestions provided for replacing non-standard phrases with standardized versions.
- Cosine similarity used for measuring phrase similarity.
- Sample standardized phrases included for demonstration.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the Text Improvement Engine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyQt5 (for the GUI)
- spaCy (for text processing)
- scikit-learn (for cosine similarity)

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 spacy scikit-learn
```

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the application:

```bash
python text_improvement_app.py
```

3. In the GUI, enter or paste the text you want to analyze.
4. Click the "Analyze Text" button to get suggestions for improvements.
5. The suggested improvements will be displayed in the text box below.

### Sample Standardized Phrases
- Optimal performance
- Utilize resources
- Enhance productivity
- Conduct an analysis
- Maintain a high standard
- Implement best practices
- Ensure compliance
- Streamline operations
- Foster innovation
- Drive growth
- Leverage synergies
- Demonstrate leadership
- Exercise due diligence
- Maximize stakeholder value
- Prioritize tasks
- Facilitate collaboration
- Monitor performance metrics
- Execute strategies
- Gauge effectiveness
- Champion change

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyQt5 (for the GUI)
- spaCy (for text processing)
- scikit-learn (for cosine similarity)

## Design Decisions
- We chose PyQt5 for the GUI to provide a user-friendly interface.
- SpaCy was selected for text processing due to its efficiency and accuracy.
- Cosine similarity with scikit-learn was used for measuring phrase similarity.
